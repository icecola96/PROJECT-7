               Hello everyone! My name is Tuan Tran and I'm a fourth year student, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Math. Currently, I'm doing research 
               in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and dream to join a top AI PhD program. I've published a paper in a tier 1 conference (SDM 2019) which focuses on 
               the problem of confounding variable. Find more about my research experience and interest in my resume and research page!
    
               I grew up in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. I was fortunate enough to brought up by a traditional family who showed me alot about the city, the culture and the food ever since I was
               little. As a result, I love and am very passionate about my city and would love to introduce Hanoi to my foreign friends! So check out the video below to learn more about a tiny aspect of Hanoi - its food.
